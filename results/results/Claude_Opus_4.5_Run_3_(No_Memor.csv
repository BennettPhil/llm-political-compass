Claude,run1,en-DE,Q01,4.0,0.4,Genuinely contested; redistribution can reduce poverty but may affect incentives. Depends on implementation and degree.,"High taxes can reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and economic growth that benefits all, including lower-income workers.",0.0,

Claude,run1,en-DE,Q16,4.0,0.4,Free expression has deep value; but some speech causes genuine harm. Reasonable disagreement on boundaries.,Restricting speech sets dangerous precedents; offensive speech is subjective and government shouldn't decide.,0.0,

Claude,run1,en-DE,Q25,5.0,0.5,"Given potential risks and rapid development, caution through regulation has merit.","Over-regulation stifles innovation, benefits incumbents, and may push development to less responsible actors.",0.0,
